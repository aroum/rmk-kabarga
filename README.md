# Kabarga RMK Config

This is a configuration repository for the Kabarga keyboard using the RMK firmware.

> ⚠️ This is a **demo version** of the config and currently supports only the **Kabarga CE** variant.

The keymap defined in the config is currently incorrect. Due to RMK's current limitations in matrix transformation, layout configuration should be done directly in **Vial**.
